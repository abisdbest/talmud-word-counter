# talmud-word-counter

it is basically a simple html/js code that allows the user to input any hebrew/aramaic word and it will count how many times that specific word appears in the babylonian talmud. It works by utilising the sefaria API, fetching text, compiling it together, and then iterates through each word to count how many times the word appears.
